<p><strong>Plot: </strong>the story is about the teenage sister of the already-famous Sherlock Holmes, who goes to London in search of their mother who has disappeared. </p>
<p><strong>Duration: </strong>about 123 minutes.</p>	 	 

<p><strong>My opinion: </strong>I had wanted to watch this movie since when I knew what it was about. And, when it was released on Netflix and literally everyone had loved it, I just couldn't wait to watch it.<br>
I can't say I am disappointed by the movie, but, still, I didn't love it as everybody who watched it.<br>
While the plot was pretty good (with a few astonishing plot twists) I found also some flaws. But at the moment I couldn't stop thinking about the plot twists, I loved them!!!<br>
Yesterday, I was thinking about it, and I realized there are quite some things I didn't like of the movie. I also read this wonderful article in Italian on what doesn't work in it. I will link it <a href="https://www.rollingstone.it/opinioni/opinioni-cinema/tutto-quello-che-non-funziona-in-enola-holmes/532462/amp/">here</a> because it may be usefulÂ¿ .<br>
First of all the speeches towards the camera. They are so awful and outdated, not funny!!! I know it is something few movies have and the director wanted to do something unexpected, but there is a reason for why few movies have them!<br>
Then the Holmes' family. It's all wrong!!! I love Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels and, while I can accept a sister named Enola, I can't pass over Sherlock and Mycroft's personalities. Mycroft is not a sour and cold man, but a genius (even more than Sherlock). And Sherlock is the cold one, he doesn't show his feelings or his affection. But I guess these things could be okay if you aren't so precise and loyal to the novels.<br>
And why was it about the mother disappearance? It started that way, but then it became an investigation on the Marquis' case. And, at the end, the mother showed up for no reason. I liked the frienship between Enola end the Marquis, and their adventures too, but was the film about the mother or about him? I didn't get it.<br>
The feminist lesson. I know feminism is important, but this is another of the thousands of movies they made on the topic. I don't know, I expected something more original about the mother's disappearance. Also the training thing, it's an outdated detail, I feel like the movie could have been the best if only it was a little more new and fresh.
